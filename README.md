# C++ College Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of C++ projects that I developed during my first year of college when I began learning programming. These projects represent my journey from a beginner to becoming more comfortable with C++ syntax, problem-solving, and implementing various algorithms and applications.

## Project Categories

### Games & Interactive Applications
- **game_tic_tac_toe.cpp** - A console-based Tic-tac-toe game implementation
- **game_number_guess.cpp** - Number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number
- **game_dice_roll.cpp** - Simulation of rolling dice with random number generation

### Mathematical Operations
- **multiplication_table_loop.cpp** - Generates a 10x10 multiplication table
- **multiplication_table_if.cpp** - Alternative approach to creating a multiplication table using if statements
- **geometry_calculator.cpp** - Calculates area and perimeter of different geometric shapes
- **arithmetic_operations.cpp** - Various multiplication operations and exercises

### Control Structures & Patterns
- **pattern_diamond.cpp** - Prints a diamond pattern using loops and control structures
- **control_structures.cpp** - Demonstrates the use of switch statements for different scenarios
- **lab_exercises.cpp** - Various lab exercises covering control flow concepts

### Time & Clock Applications
- **digital_clock.cpp** - Implementation of a digital clock with various functionalities

### File Operations
- **file_operations.cpp** - Demonstrates reading from and writing to files in C++
- **UsersScores.txt**, **2D_data.txt**, **rand.txt**, **resultfile.txt** - Various data files used by the programs

### Exam Tasks & Assignments
- **exam_task_basics.cpp**, **exam_task_arrays.cpp**, **exam_task_advanced.cpp** - Solutions to exam problems

### Basic Programs
- **basic_program_1.cpp**, **basic_program_2.cpp**, **basic_program_3.cpp**, **basic_program_4.cpp**, **basic_program_5.cpp** - Simple programs demonstrating fundamental concepts
- **basic_test.cpp** - Testing basic programming constructs
- **reference_examples.cpp** - Examples of reference code for learning purposes

## Concepts Covered
- Basic C++ syntax and semantics
- Control structures (if-else, switch, loops)
- Functions and procedures
- File I/O operations
- Random number generation
- Arrays and matrices
- Simple game logic
- Basic algorithm implementation

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual C++, Clang)
- Basic terminal/command prompt knowledge

### Compiling and Running
To compile any of the programs, navigate to the project directory and use a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o filename
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./filename
```

For example:

```bash
g++ game_tic_tac_toe.cpp -o game_tic_tac_toe
./game_tic_tac_toe
```

## Educational Note
These projects were created as part of a learning process and demonstrate the progression of skills in C++ programming. They are meant for educational purposes and showcase various programming concepts and techniques as they were learned. Some programs might follow beginner practices rather than professional standards, reflecting the learning journey.

Feel free to explore, use, and learn from these projects as you begin your own programming journey!
